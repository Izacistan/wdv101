    <p><strong><em>Welcome to the Koala Bear National Information Center!</em></strong>
      In this site you can learn about Koala bears, adopt a Koala,
      give to our foundation, sign up for our newsletter, or schedule a visit. 
      Please take some time to explore the information provided in this site!
    </p>

    <p><em>The Koala Bear National Information Center (KBNIC)</em> is the principal non-profit,
      non-government organization dedicated to the conservation and effective management of
      the wild koala and its habitat.
    </p>

    <p>The KBNIC was formed in 2006. Since our founding  the KBNIC has grown from a small group
      of people interested in researching koala disease, to a well-known, global organization with
      a strong track record in strategic koala research, conservation and community education with
      a huge focus on mapping -- our absolute strength.
    </p>

    <p>Koalas are disappearing. Loss of koala habitat and koala food trees (eucalyptus leaves)
      is the leading koala threat. Our cuddly koalas are loved around the world. Often called
      a koala bear, they are actually marsupials not koala bears. Please help koalas by supporting
      the Koala Bear Information Center.
