      <p>The many worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game are places of
        magic and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures.
        They begin with a foundation of medieval fantasy and then add the
        creatures, places, and magic that make these worlds unique.</p>
      <img src="IMG/lostMinesOfPhandelver.jpg" alt="A Dungeons and Dragons party facing a green dragon">
      <p>All these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart
        by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and races,
        fantastic geography, ancient dungeons, and scheming villains. Some
        races have unusual traits in different worlds. The halflings of the
        Dark Sun setting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals, and
        the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races unknown in
        other settings, such as Eberron’s warforged, soldiers created and
        imbued with life to fight in the Last War. Some worlds are dominated
         by one great story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central
         role in the Dragonlance setting. But they’re all D&D worlds, and you
         can use the rules here to create a character and play in any one of
         them.</p>
      <p>Your DM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that
        he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds
        of D&D, you should check with your DM about any house rules that will
        affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is the
        authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the setting is a
        published world.</p>

      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>The play of the Dungeons & Dragons game unfolds according to this basic pattern.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>The DM describes the environment.</strong> The DM tells the players where
          their adventurers are and what’s around them, presenting the basic
          scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of
           a room, what’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).
        </li>
        <li><strong>The players describe what they want to do.</strong> Sometimes one player
          speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for
          example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one
          adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an
          esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for
          monsters. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens
          to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.
          Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk
          across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door
          opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked,
          the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might
           make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those
           cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a
           die to determine the results of an action.
         </li>
        <li><strong>The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’ actions.</strong>
          Describing the results often leads to another decision point,
          which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Game Dice</h3>
      <p>The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides.
        You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.</p>
      <img src="IMG/dice.png" alt="A graphic of the seven dice used in Dungeons and Dragons">
      <p>In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed
        by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a
        six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).</p>
      <p>Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number
        between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9.
        One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the
        ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s
        represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on),
        making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case,
        a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.</p>
      <p>When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type,
        as well as what modifiers to add. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-sided
        dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.</p>
      <p>The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of
        1d3, roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2,
        roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even.
        (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die,
        it’s a 2.)</p>
