        <h2>Daily Care</h2>
        <p>Owners of Alaskan Huskies don't often need to worry about their fur, as it is a great coat to protect their skin and body in every weather condition.
        A new coat of fur will grow every year and for the most part you just need to brush them and give them a shower on a regular basis.</p>

        <h2>Health Concerns</h2>
        <p>Alaskan Huskies typically live to be 12 through 15 years old. Generally speaking, they are considered a very healthy breed of dog.
        However, there are still some diseases which they have inherited from other dogs in their bloodline.</p>
        <p>These can include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Retinal Atrophy</li>
          <li>Larynx issues</li>
          <li>Hypothyroidism</li>
          <li>and more...</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Feeding</h2>
      <p>Alaskan Huskies prefer a high-protein diet and generally do not care for raw food items. Like many dogs, they can have allergies to certain types of food, so it is up to you as an owner to keep an eye on them and see how they react to what they're eating.
      It is discouraged to give huskies bones, however, as it can injure their mouths.
      We also recommend a "seasonal diet" in which you give your husky more fat and protein in the winter and less during the summer.</p>
      <h2>Exercise</h2>
      <p>Huskies have lots of energy and love to play! Games such as fetch are a favorite and it gives them plenty of opportunities to stretch their legs and workout their heart.
      Whenever you leave the house, if you are able, take your husky with you! They love to go for walks and see other people and dogs.
      Typically a husky needs about 30 minutes of exercise per day. So make it part of your morning routine and get outside and play with your husky!</p>
