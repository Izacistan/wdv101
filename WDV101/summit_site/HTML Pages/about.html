      <h1>About Alaskan Huskies</h1>
      <h2>Bred to Sled</h2>
      <p>The Alaskan Husky is a medium-sized sled dog and has been bred specifically for this purpose.
      They are the most common dog for competitive sled racing, both long and short distance.
      Alaskan Huskies are descendants of Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes, both of whom it shares many physical traits.</p>

        <h4>Behavior</h4>
        <p>Alaskan Huskies are usually selectively bread, with breeders considering factors like, problem-solving and temperament.
        Overall, their behavior can vary wildly, due to a wide variety of genetic backgrounds and bred-purposes.
        Since Alaskan Huskies usually need to be working directly next to other days, mental-soundess is crucial to most sled-dogs.
        Since many of these dogs work around spectators, they generally need to be able to focus and behave themselves around lots of unfamiliar people.</p>
